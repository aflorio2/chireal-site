  description: >
    A junior school in theoretical physics held annually in the Swiss Alps,
    designed to foster collaboration among young researchers through lectures
    bridging different areas of modern theoretical physics. The series focuses
    on quantum information theory, quantum computing, entanglement in QFT, and
    holography. Fully funded by SwissMAP with accommodation and meals covered.

  description: >
    Modern software package for lattice simulations of field dynamics in an
    expanding universe. Supports interacting scalar field theories, Abelian U(1)
    and non-Abelian SU(2) gauge theories in flat or FLRW backgrounds. Features
    gravitational wave computation modules and customizable field description
    language. Actively developed and freely available for research use.

  description: >
    DFG-funded junior research group (Project #545261797) investigating anomalous
    transport effects on topology-changing processes in the Standard Model.
    Combines classical numerical simulations with quantum computing techniques to
    study real-time field-theoretic dynamics in 1D and 2D systems. Aims to achieve
    quantum advantage in simulating early universe evolution and quark-gluon plasma.

# CRC-TR 211 Project A02
- title: "CRC-TR 211: Strong-Interaction Matter"
  subtitle: "Project A02 [To be filled in]"
  group: featured

  link: https://crc-tr211.org/
  description: >
    Collaborative Research Centre (TransRegio) examining strong-interaction matter
    under extreme conditions from a theoretical perspective. Partners: Bielefeld,
    Darmstadt, and Frankfurt universities. Combines complex numerical simulations
    on supercomputers (lattice QCD) with analytical methods to study matter at
    temperatures and densities present in the early Universe and heavy-ion collisions.
    [Project A02 specific details to be added by PI]
