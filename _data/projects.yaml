  description: >
    Modern software package for lattice simulations of field dynamics in an
    expanding universe. Supports interacting scalar field theories, Abelian U(1)
    and non-Abelian SU(2) gauge theories in an expanding universe, including
    gravitational waves production. De facto community standard, actively
    developed and [open source](https://github.com/cosmolattice/cosmolattice).

  description: >
    A junior school in theoretical physics held annually in the Swiss Alps,
    designed to foster collaboration among young researchers through lectures
    given by rising stars in different areas of modern theoretical physics.
    Topics include quantum information theory, quantum computing, entanglement
    in QFT, and holography. The next edition will take place on
    [17-22 May 2026](https://swissmaprs.ch/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-SRS-Programme.pdf).
    Links to previous editions: [ALPS I](https://indico.global/event/9618/),
    [ALPS II](https://indico.global/event/9641/).
