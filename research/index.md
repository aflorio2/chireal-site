# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research group explores the intersection of quantum information theory and quantum field theory, with a particular focus on real-time evolution and non-equilibrium dynamics. We combine analytical methods with cutting-edge computational techniques including lattice field theory simulations and quantum computing approaches. Our work spans quantum information in gauge theories (entanglement, entropy, and confinement), far-from-equilibrium dynamics (thermalization, quantum quenches, and jet production), quantum computing applications to lattice field theory, early universe cosmology (preheating and gravitational waves), and critical dynamics near the QCD chiral phase transition.
