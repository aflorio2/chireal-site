# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research group explores the intersection of quantum information theory and quantum field theory, with a particular focus on real-time evolution and non-equilibrium dynamics. We combine analytical methods with cutting-edge computational techniques including lattice field theory simulations and quantum computing approaches.

## Research Areas

### Quantum Information in QFT
We investigate how quantum information concepts like entanglement, entropy, and negativity manifest in quantum field theories. This includes studying entanglement dynamics in gauge theories, particularly in the context of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking.

### Real-Time Evolution and Non-Equilibrium Dynamics
Our work focuses on understanding far-from-equilibrium dynamics in quantum field theories, including thermalization processes, quantum quenches, and jet production. We develop novel computational methods for real-time lattice simulations.

### Quantum Computing for Lattice Field Theory
We pioneer applications of quantum computing to lattice gauge theories, developing adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers and exploring how to leverage quantum hardware for studying gauge theory dynamics.

### Cosmology and Early Universe Physics
We study preheating after inflation, gravitational wave production, and the development of advanced lattice simulation codes (CosmoLattice) for cosmological field dynamics.

### Critical Dynamics in QCD
Our research explores the dynamical signatures of the QCD chiral phase transition, including critical slowing down, model G dynamics, and connections to heavy-ion collision experiments.
