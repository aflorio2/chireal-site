## Our Mission

Our research aims to advance the understanding of quantum field theory beyond equilibrium, combining analytical methods with state-of-the-art numerical simulations. We develop and apply innovative techniques to tackle fundamental questions in quantum dynamics, quantum information, and real-time field evolution.

## Research Areas

### Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics
We investigate how quantum fields behave far from thermal equilibrium, exploring thermalization, scrambling, and the emergence of classical behavior from quantum systems.

### Quantum Information in Field Theory
Our work connects quantum information theory with quantum field theory, studying entanglement dynamics, quantum complexity, and information flow in field theoretic systems.

### Real-Time Simulations
We develop and employ advanced numerical methods for real-time evolution of quantum and classical fields, including lattice field theory techniques and modern computational approaches.
