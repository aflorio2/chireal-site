## Research interests

Vasundhara Krishnan is a PhD student in the $\left\lvert\chi\right\rangle$real (Quantum Information and Real-time evolution in QFT) Emmy Noether research group at Bielefeld University.
Her current research focuses on random tensor networks in holography and pseudo-random unitaries. She is investigating how tensor networks can be used to calculate entropy bounds for highly entangled systems, and exploring the use of Haar measure and random tensor networks as toy models for holographic bulk-to-boundary mapping. Her work involves understanding approximations of Haar random unitaries through t-designs and pseudo-random unitaries, as well as studying multi-partite entanglement measures for special classes of tensor networks consistent with topological quantum field theory.
