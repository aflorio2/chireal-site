# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

The QuIReal group is an Emmy Noether research group at Bielefeld University
dedicated to exploring quantum information and real-time evolution in quantum
field theory. We combine analytical methods with numerical simulations to
tackle fundamental questions at the intersection of quantum mechanics and
high-energy physics.

## {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-user-plus" %}Join Our Team

We are always interested in motivated researchers who want to explore quantum
field theory and quantum information. If you're interested in joining our group
as a postdoc, PhD student, or visiting researcher, please get in touch!

### Funding Opportunities

We actively support group members and prospective researchers in applying for
external funding. If you're interested in joining the group through competitive
fellowships, we can provide guidance and support for applications to programs
such as:

- [DFG Walter Benjamin Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) - for postdoctoral researchers
- [Humboldt Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/humboldt-research-fellowship) - for experienced researchers and postdocs
- [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) - for postdoctoral researchers

If you have ideas for collaborative research and would like to discuss potential
funding opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out.
