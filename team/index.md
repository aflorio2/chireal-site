# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

The QuIReal group is an Emmy Noether research group at Bielefeld University
dedicated to exploring quantum information and real-time evolution in quantum
field theory. We combine analytical methods with numerical simulations to
tackle fundamental questions at the intersection of quantum mechanics and
high-energy physics.
