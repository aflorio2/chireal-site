The QuIReal group is an Emmy Noether research group at Bielefeld University
dedicated to exploring quantum information and real-time evolution in quantum
field theory. We combine analytical methods with numerical simulations to
tackle fundamental questions at the intersection of quantum mechanics and
high-energy physics.

We are always interested in motivated researchers who want to explore quantum
field theory and quantum information. In particular, if you are interested in
applying with us to some external funding opportunities such as
[DFG Walter Benjamin Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin),
[Humboldt Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/humboldt-research-fellowship),
or [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships),
do not hesitate to reach out.
