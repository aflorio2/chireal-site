# Welcome to QuIReal

## Quantum Information and Real-time evolution in field theories

We are a theoretical physics research group specializing in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum fields, quantum information aspects of field theory, and real-time simulations of quantum and classical fields.

Our research focuses on:
- Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum fields
- Quantum information aspects of field theory
- Real-time simulations of quantum and classical fields
- Quantum field theory methods and applications
